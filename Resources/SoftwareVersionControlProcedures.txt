Source Control Workflow

Branches:

master(production)
	staging-beta(testing)
	development(equal to staging-beta, not deployed)
		features/
		bugs/
		chores/
		hotfixes/
		releases/
		
Pull from development(rebase okay)

Create new branch, i.e.

features/really_cool_thing_pivotalNumber

or

bugs/save_the_day_pivotalNumber

Make changes, then commit like so:

[(Finishes|Fixes|Delivers) #TRACKER_STORY_ID] Brief Description
-Commit Message comments go here
-“...“
-“…"

Create pull request in GitHub.

Merge your local branch with staging-beta, then merge staging-beta with development.

All merges to master(production) will be done by the team lead.
